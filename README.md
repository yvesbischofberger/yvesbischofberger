Hi, my name is Yves Bischofberger and im currently studying Computer Science in the bachelor at ETH ZÃ¼rich

Here I will (very irregularly) upload selected projects. There is nothing here yet, but there will be soon :). 

I'm very interested in Cyber Security, Computer Vision and Data Science, so the lion's share of projects will be about either one of them.
But also other projects are in the pipeline (e.g. a smartMirror-ish GUI for raspberry pi is waiting for me in the depth of my files to be cleaned up and published).
