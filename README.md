Hi, my name is Yves Bischofberger. I've previously studies Computer Science at ETH in my bachelor's.

Here I will (very irregularly) upload selected projects.

I'm very interested in Cyber Security, Computer Vision and Data Science, so the lion's share of projects will be about either one of them.
But also other projects are in the pipeline (e.g. a smartMirror-ish GUI for raspberry pi is waiting for me in the depth of my files to be cleaned up and published).
